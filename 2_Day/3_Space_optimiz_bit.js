// **There are many situations where we use integer values as index in array to see presence or absence. We can use bit manipulations to optimize space in such problems.**

// **Let us consider the below problem as an example.**

// **Given two numbers say a and b, mark the multiples of 2 and 5 between a and b and output each of the multiples.**

// **Note : We have to mark the multiples i.e save (key, value) pairs in memory such that each key either has a value as 1 or 0 representing a multiple of 2 or 5 or not respectively.**

// **Examples :**

// **Input : 2 10**

// **Output : 2 4 5 6 8 10**

// **Input: 60 95**
