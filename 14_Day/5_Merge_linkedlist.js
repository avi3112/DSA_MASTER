// Merge a linked list into another linked list at alternate positions
// Let us look at what the problem says:

// Given two singly-linked lists, merge the second list into the first list at alternating positions; if the second link list includes extra nodes, print them as well. The nodes in the second list will be inserted only when positions are available.
// Linked list 1:- 1 --> 2 --> 3 --> null
// Linked list 2:- 4 --> 5 --> 6 --> null
// Output after merging:- 1 --> 4 --> 2 --> 5 --> 3 --> 6 --> null
